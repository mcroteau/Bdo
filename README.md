# Bdo CRM

Bdo is a simple Open Source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) package built for people and organizations who want to manage a small to mid sized sales team.

### What is Bdo if you are a business owner

Bdo helps you manage your sales cycles, prospects, clients and customers. It allows you to measure your activities giving you a detailed view into your actions and how productive they are. Bdo also serves as a centralized location helping you manage everything regarding a prospect or client. Employ ABC to deploy, run and manage your instance or configure it yourself. It's as simple as a command (minimal setup version).

### What is Bdo if you are a developer

Bdo is a J2EE project, it is:

* Spring Boot
* Hibernate
* Gradle
* Sitemesh
* Groovy

The framework used to develop the project is called Grails. Grails can be considered a serious productivity tool instead of a framework. A light weight framework that sits on top of J2EE project architecture where Groovy is leveraged when deployed becomes a J2EE project.

Grails is domain driven, leverages Groovy which is an abstraction of Java (you can write Java code within a Groovy class file), object oriented and in summary is a productivity tool. Attempt to write the same logic in any other technology stack of choice without missing out on Java's greatest assets and you're talking years of development instead of months. Customizations are quick as well. Everything, Models, Views and Controllers are nicely configured/glued together to create one seemless development experience.

https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781590599952 is a little dated, but gives a great run down of MVC (Model View Controller setup), Grails and why it is important. Not very many assumptions are made on how much you know, you will be starting from scratch with this book.

Bdo deploys to an Java application server of choice or can be run locally in an embedded container
You can use many of the RDBM systems out there (Postgres, MySQL) and have been configured to work with Mongo and others.


### What is our goal if you are a developer

We are local to the United States but understand the income disparity between certain areas of the World. Thats why we wrote Hilo and Bdo. We would like to create a product suite that can be used in other parts with as little as possible configuration changes. So you if you are local to another part of the World and would like to promote the project elsewhere, we could use translation support and maybe help in development. Feel free to fork at will.
